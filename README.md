# TRLM8620-Final
This is the final project for TRLM8620. Students will clone this repo to create their own shopping website by switching the content, and localize the website.
Introduction about our shopping website:
JustCocktail is a cocktail shopping website. Customers can choose from different categories and purchase cocktails they like. The ingredients of each cocktail are also listed in the product pages.
